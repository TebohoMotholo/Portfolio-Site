                            <p>I’m <strong>Teboho Motholo</strong>, a curious and forward-thinking IT professional with a foundation in technical support and a growing passion for data and development. I thrive on problem-solving and see technology as a tool to empower people and transform how we work and make decisions. 
                                While I’ve built my career ensuring systems run smoothly and users get the help they need, I’m now focused on the future, moving into the world of data analysis, data science, and software development.</p>

                            <h3>Professional Background</h3>
                            <p>I’ve spent the past few years working as an IT Support Technician, most recently at Finbond Mutual Bank, where I supported over 170 branches nationally. My responsibilities included setting up secure systems, managing hardware and software issues, and ensuring business continuity through remote 
                                tools like TeamViewer, Miradore, and Splashtop. Before that, I gained valuable hands-on experience at Makro Bloemfontein, honing my technical abilities in network setup and end-user support. While I’ve learned a lot from supporting IT infrastructure, my true interest lies in building solutions, 
                                analyzing data, and writing code that solves real-world problems. I bring to this journey not only technical resilience and attention to detail, but also a commitment to growth and adaptability in fast-changing environments.</p>

                            <h3>My Personal Story</h3>
                            <p>My journey began in a small school where I helped teachers with basic tech issues. That early exposure to solving real problems with simple tools lit a spark in me. Since then, I’ve pursued a BSc in Information Technology from North-West University and have never stopped learning. 
                                I’m constantly studying,  from Python and SQL to data visualization and cloud fundamentals, because I believe the best way to stay relevant in tech is to stay hungry for knowledge.What sets me apart is my drive to go beyond one specialty. I’m drawn to data because it tells stories, 
                                reveals patterns, and drives better decisions. I’m excited about development because it allows me to build and automate. I see myself evolving into a multi-skilled tech professional who can work across support, development, and data, and that’s exactly where I’m heading.</p>

                            <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
                            <p>
                                Looking ahead, I’m eager to leverage my strong IT skills and experience in the following areas:
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Business Intelligence &amp; Data Analytics:</strong> building dashboards, KPI reports and visualizations to drive data-informed decisions.</p>
                            <p><strong>Data Engineering:</strong> designing and optimizing ETL pipelines, data lakes/warehouses, and scalable cloud-based architectures.</p>
                            <p><strong>Software &amp; Web Development:</strong> crafting responsive, full-stack applications using modern frameworks to solve real-world problems.</p>
                            <p>
                                By combining these disciplines, I aim to turn complex data into actionable insights and build robust tools that empower teams and organizations to innovate continuously.
